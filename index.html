                                <p> 
                                    Nightly sleep patterns play an important role in clinically evaluating sleep quality.
                                    These patterns are commonly characterised by distinct sleep stages quantifiable 
                                    through EEG measurements. Stage stages (Awake, N1, N2, N3, REM), traditionally, 
                                    are classified by sleep technicians throughout all-night EEG recordings. While this 
                                    method is accurate, it is, however, time-consuming. In response, the project aims to 
                                    develop an AI-based sleep stage classifier capable of automating and expediting this 
                                    classification process. The algorithm development comprises the process of artefact 
                                    removal, feature extraction and ML algorithm development.

                                EEG signals, when recorded, are susceptable to contamination from artefacts. These artefacts 
                                are not inherent to the neural activity being measured but are introduced during the recording 
                                process. It is crucial to remove artefacts as contaminated EEG data can profoundly affect the 
                                analysis. Previous studies have employed various techniques to tackle this issue, including 
                                Regression, ICA, BSS, and Wavelet Transform.

                                    Battery research has become of critical significance due to its important role in 
                                    addressing energy and sustainability challenges. The increasing demand for portable 
                                    electronics, electric vehicles and renewable energy storage solutions highlights the 
                                    importance of developing efficient, durable and cost-effective batteries.

                                Some of these particles might overlap so it is required to reposition.

                                otherwise, the move is rejected and the particle is returned to its original position.

                                    Compton scattering is a phenomenon that occurs when a photon interacts with an outer orbital electron. 
                                    This interaction results in the transfer of energy from the photon to the electron, causing the photon 
                                    to be deflected from its original path. To investigate this process, our project involved both practical 
                                    experiments and computational simulations. 

                                    <br> During our practical experiment, we directed photons emitted by Cs-137 and meticulously measured the 
                                    energies of the scattered photons across different angles. Meanwhile, in our computational simulations, we 
                                    developed a program that generates random events with statistical distributions for photon positions, directions 
                                    and angles to simulate this phenomenon in a 2D environment. By comparing our experimental findings with computational
                                    simulations, we could obtain a comprehensive understanding of Compton Scattering.

                                    The Standard Model (SM) is a framework to understand the behaviour of fundamental particles 
                                    and their interactions through EM, weak and strong forces. In particle physics research, 
                                    scientists test the predictions of the SM against experimental observations to ensure its 
                                    consistency. Any deviations from expected patterns in these observations may indicate the 
                                    presence of phenomena beyond the SM. 

                                    <br> In this project, our primary focus was on investigating B meson decay using a large 
                                    dataset collected from LHcb. Our goal was to analyse the coefficients of a specific angular 
                                    distribution equation to uncover any deviations from the expected patterns predicted by the 
                                    Standard Model. Our analysis included several steps: removing background noise from the signal, 
                                    applying acceptance functions, fitting the data with the angular distribution equation, 
                                    quantifying errors and ultimately comparing the results with those predicted by the Standard Model.

                                    The project explored strategies for underwater search and rescue operations, 
                                    with a focus on employing Bayesian inference as a key approach. Bayesian Inference 
                                    provided a robust framework for updating our beliefs and making probabilistic 
                                    inferences based on observed data and prior knowledge. This facilitated iterative 
                                    refinement of search strategies as new information emerged during operations. 
                                    The investigation involved assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of search and 
                                    rescue missions utilising Bayesian inference, contrasting its performance with random 
                                    search.

                                <p> 
                                    Higgs boson is one of the fundamental particles associated with the quantum excitation 
                                    of the Higgs field. The Higgs boson was not discovered until the ATLAS and CMS experiments 
                                    at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in 2012. 

                                    <br> Physicists are interested in the regions where the signal is more significant than 
                                    merely the background. However, sometimes they might unintentionally optimise the analysis 
                                    in certain regions that have a higher chance of rare decays happening to obtain expected 
                                    results. To avoid such bias, blind analysis is presented. The regions that have more decay 
                                    events than expected are blinded during the process of data analysis, and only the region 
                                    satisfied with the criteria can be unblinded. 

                                    <br> The project performed a simplified version of data analysis for discovering the Higgs 
                                    boson. It aims to optimise the analysis in the region that has the highest chance of detecting 
                                    the signal, where the region is selected by blind analysis.

                            <p> We pinpointed the region where Higgs decay events showed a significant surplus over background noise and 
                                quantified this excess using signal significance (S). Through thorough data analysis, our goal was to 
                                differentiate genuine Higgs decay occurrences from background events and noise.

                                    Utilising object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, we developed an animation to simulate gas behaviour. 
                                    This dynamic visualisation enabled us to observe gas molecules' movements, collisions, and transformations 
                                    in real-time in response to changes in temperature, pressure, and volume. Through this simulation, we verified 
                                    the ideal gas law and Boltzmann distribution.
